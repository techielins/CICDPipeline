This is a Jenkins pipeline that automates the entire CI/CD process for a Java application using popular tools like Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, and Kubernetes. It includes the following steps:

1. Setting up an EC2 instance in AWS: This step explains how to set up an EC2 instance in AWS, which will be used as the Jenkins server.

2. Installing Jenkins on an EC2 instance: This step explains how to install Jenkins on the EC2 instance and configure it.

3. Installing plugins: This step explains how to install the required plugins for the pipeline, including the Docker Pipeline plugin, Maven Integration plugin, and Pipeline plugin.

4. Docker Slave Configuration: This step explains how to install Docker on the EC2 instance and grant Jenkins user and ec2-user user permission to the Docker daemon.

5. Installing ArgoCD on Kubernetes: This step explains how to install ArgoCD on Kubernetes, which will be used to deploy the Java application.

The readme file inside Jenkins-k8s folder provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform each of these steps, including commands to run and links to external resources. It also includes notes to help users understand what each step does and what they can expect to see at each stage of the process.

Overall, this pipeline provides an end-to-end solution for automating the CI/CD process for a Java application, from code checkout to target environment deployment, using popular tools like SonarQube, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
